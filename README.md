# RapidDungeon
Augmented Reality project intended to create digital representations of paper level prototypes for a game developer. Could be expanded on to make an AR game or other fun application. Due to hardware limitations at the time of development, and Vuforia licensing changed, I will not be going back to improve this project. Stripped of potentially copywritten assets.
